# RedditScrapingHelloFreshUK

Introduction and Setup: The notebook begins with importing essential libraries such as praw (Python Reddit API Wrapper) for interacting with Reddit's API, pandas for data handling, and others for data visualization like matplotlib and seaborn.

Reddit API Authentication: The notebook demonstrates authenticating with Reddit's API using credentials like client ID and secret. It then accesses a specific subreddit, in this case, hellofresh.

Display Subreddit Information: The notebook includes code to display basic information about the hellofresh subreddit, such as its display name, title, and description.

Scraping Posts: It includes sections for scraping posts from the hellofresh subreddit. For example, it retrieves and prints titles of hot posts and then scrapes top posts from the past year, including details like title, post text, ID, score, total comments, and post URL.

Data Organization: The scraped data is organized into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.

Data Analysis and Visualization:I convert them into csv files for analyzig the comments and posts posted in the subreddit.

Natural Language Processing:
By sorting the posts in the subreddit, I went through the comments to understand the semantics whether a comment is POSITIVE, NEGATIVE OR NEUTRAL.

FINAL RESULT AND CONCLUSION:

THE r/hellofresh subreddit is in the top 5% in the food/cooking/meal prep division with 45,300 members created on September 14th.

Based on the semantics, 65% of the comments were POSITIVE. 17.5 % is negative and the other percentage is NEUTRAL.

Each of these subreddits has multiple posts on HelloFresh products.

The Negative comments were ususally based on products being lower in quantity or it became too expensive.
Thus RETENTION being the Major Problem. (This is for all Meal Kit prep food industry companies)
People want new products and this is what WE have to tackle.

The best possible way to sell more HelloFresh Products from a REDDIT perspective is;
Having a member of HelloFresh team being a mod and promoting new products and marketing as well as spreading awareness of how healthy HelloFresh is.

HelloFresh is a LIFESTYLE and there is large scope for it.
