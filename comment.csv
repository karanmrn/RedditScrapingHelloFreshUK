"I did hellofresh for years.  I like trying new recipes and it was cool to get food that I normally wouldn't.  I stopped because the quality of produce went down significantly.   I would get veggies on the verge of spoiling or would be missing ingredients.   You can complain and they will give you money off your next box, but after weeks of this I gave up.  I would also say it's not cheap if you are on a strict budget.  I could make similar foods that are cheaper.  It was great to try out and learn, but I dont think its worth it if you are trying to eat cheap."
"It's totally legitimate that you're having difficulty budgeting for one because cooking gets progressively cheaper per meal the more meals you're making at once. Fresh meat and produce in the USA (where I'm guessing you live given you're shopping at Meijer) tends to be sold in quantities that can't be used effectively for one person and shopping for individual veggies is way more expensive per oz than in bulk. Some of the ways you can mitigate this is by:

* Planning out your meals for the week such that recipes are using the same ingredients
* Adjusting your diet to meal-prepping (and the associated repetitiveness)
* Buying perishables that can be frozen, or cooking meals that can be frozen

If you're new to cooking, there are a few things to consider as benefits to a meal order kit: you get all the ""extras"" like oils, spices, etc instead of having to buy them and manage a pantry, you get exposure to new recipes and cooking techniques, and you get a new meal every day (with maybe leftovers for lunch as your only repeats). Subscribing for a few weeks might be what you need to figure out exactly what you like, what your pantry needs, and how you can start planning these sorts of meals for yourself to mitigate the subscription costs. However, I don't think it's a sustainable model and if you're an experienced cook with a good number of recipes you're already comfortable with, it probably isn't worth it to begin with.

Also, as a fellow Midwesterner, you may want to look at other stores than Meijer for price comparisons. Meijer's model has some really good deals on certain items but generally overpriced items throughout the rest of the store. Walmart will have much better prices for spices and Aldi will be better for veggies and meat."
"All of those services are over-priced. You can buy your own equivalents for much less, though I understand the appeal for those who want to try dishes they've never made before without all the research, planning and shopping required to do that on your own."
"We use EveryPlate but definitely not for the frugality/health factor, although there's a good variety of meals to choose from. I like trying new dishes with spices I wouldn't normally buy, and having to think very little about what I'm cooking that night. 

We switched from HelloFresh because of the reasons already listed. Quality is diminishing and prices are going up."
"In the last year we have tried: Every Plate, Hello Fresh, Gobble, and Dinnerly. The cheapest meal box we used was Dinnerly.  Exponentially less than Hello Fresh, minimal plastic packaging. Every Plate was a close 2nd as far as costs. I do wish both had fewer dairy based recipes.

As someone who HATES meal planning and shopping (99% of the time I do drive up or delivery svcs), having the meal plans was worth any money saved vs couponing, going to multiple shops."
[deleted]
"It definitely isn't the cheapest, but I think a ton of the negativity they get is from people who already know how to cook/shop for themselves. They taught me how to feed myself like an adult and try a bunch of stuff I never would have without them

I don't have a subscription with them anymore but as someone who grew up on fast food/dine in/take out every single day they really helped get me started. When I started them I was 260ish lbs in fall of 2020(put on weight very fast eating Taco Bell every day during the beginning of the pandemic), about 230 when I stopped in fall of 2021, I'm 215 now and shop for myself but I still cook one of their recipes every week(just buy my own ingredients) because I saved all the recipe cards they sent. 

Ive recommended them to about a dozen friends and co-workers when they become interested in cooking after seeing/trying my meals now and every single one has signed up for the service and enjoyed the ease of mind it gives to beginners/busy people."
Try Budget Bytes website! Meal plans for around 12$ for the month and she breaks down the cost of everything. Or you can just browse by what you like. I’ve gotten good breakfast and no cook lunch ideas from there when I get bored and need something new.
They sell single ingredients wrapped in a massive amount of plastic. Nothing frugal about it. You’d get more bang for your buck buying and cooking in bulk.
"HelloFresh is the best cooking class I could have paid for for my teenager. She learned lots of skills and after a few months wanted to cook through a cookbook. We ate quite well, although some recipes were bland. It’s hard for me to say if the cost is worth it for somebody else because we could have eaten cheaper, but I wasn’t really available for the work that would have taken during that period. It’s important to live within your means, but food for you is worthy of your resources."
"I like Hello Fresh and other meal kits a lot, personally. They actually get me to cook rather than just eating takeout all the time. But I never pay full price - cycling discounts is the way to go."
Not frugal.
Dinnerly is much more affordable
Everyplate is half the price and owned by hello fresh. Way more worth it
"$100 a week for groceries is a lot, and i live in eugene oregon. i spend 50-60 a week and make fresh, produce-filled meals all week."
"Did HelloFresh for 2 years during the pandemic. Although it was nice in the beginning, after a while the quality of produce decreased. Also sometimes portions were so small that it did not feel like a cheap option at $9 per portion."
I feed a family of three for $300 a month. There is nothing frugal about those companies. They are convenient and a great way to try new recipes if you have money to burn.
"If you're trying to cut back on costs, then a subscription meal service is probably just a bad idea..."
"We do EveryPlate and it’s cheap as they get ($38/wk for 3 meals - 2 decent sized servings per meal). It’s not always the healthiest, but it helps us practice moderation rather than getting second helpings for every meal. 

So if you’re looking to do portion control and staying away from processed frozen foods, that could be an option. 

Advice: Do the 2-person plan, so you can have an extra meal for lunch or leftovers. They are great portion sizes.

**Edited to say:** Also, HelloFresh owns EveryPlate."
"True.

If you're working a lot of overtime, or two jobs, then that that convenience is worth *more* than saving 80 bucks a week by 'shopping around.'

 If it is worth it, for your situation, then go for it.

 It wasn't bad food. The directions were clear and turned out as expected. The produce quality was a bit of a roulette wheel and the protein portions are very small for the price.

Edit: typo"
"I hate these food boxes. They don't save me any time, certainly don't save me money, and they create so much waste. Apparently they are good if you regularly create food waste, but the real answer to that is better home economy."
">The big difference is that once the spices, sugars, and oils are purchased more money will be saved for future online recipes. The price after initial purchase would be roughly $85.

Well, there you go.

>Does anyone else fight with this dilemma that they are spending too much on food for just themselves? How do you make food work with your finances? Opinions on me doing HelloFresh?

Sure.  Though, I feed a family of four.

We mostly eat vegetarian.  I shop at multiple stores for better pricing.  Buying in bulk where I can and it pays off.

Do you.  But think of it as a luxury expense and not a way to save money."
"Tried it several times. The produce was very hit or miss and there was a lot of packaging. I also had leaking chicken breasts a couple of times or off fish. I spend the same or less on breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the week when I cook for myself.

Edit: And the food I cook is healthier."
"I have been using hungryroot lately, the packaging is much less and you can choose recipes or order items. But their meals are not labor intensive and we always have extra  of items to make a meal. Like if your having a sandwich, they send a full package if bread or a whole thing of lettuce. But we're 2 people so it works + i work 7 days/week so I will pay for the convenience. It's not much more expensive than grocery shopping."
"HelloFresh really helped me when I was depressed and unwilling to make decisions on what to cook, but I knew cooking for myself would help my mental health more than eating out.

I'd get the 3 recipes plan for about $60, and depending on the size of the portions, I could get 3 meals out of each recipe. I also got my initial subscription through a podcast discount, and I keep periodically canceling my subscription, waiting for a discount offer email, then reactivating my subscription until the discount runs out. 

I like the HelloFresh recipes - the flavor profiles really appeal to me, and I prefer their vegetarian options. (I've also tried Green Chef, I dislike their vegetarian recipes. Weird flavor combos.) It saves me a lot of mental energy. I've been able to try recipes I wouldn't have otherwise tried, and without buying too much food in case I don't like it. 

However - the ingredient quality for HelloFresh has really gone downhill. Like another commenter said, I'd open a bag 2 days after it was delivered to find moldy veggies. The total recipe portions seem to have gone down too - I used to get 3 servings, but the last time I got a box I could only get two servings. (Yes, I know I was only getting the 2-serving boxes, but when I used to get more food from the same recipe, I feel like I'm getting ripped off.) My deliveries would get delayed for no reason, which probably contributed to the food-quality issue. They do use A TON of plastic packaging. 

Now, I'm trying to meal plan for myself using the recipe cards I have, and either roll dice so I don't have to make decisions, or try to pick recipes with ingredients in common to save money."
"I haven’t tried HelloFresh, but use Goodfoods semi-regularly.

 It will never be frugal or healthy compared to going to the grocery store and cooking my standard weeknight food - in part because I meal prep so I can still make sure that I’m using everything I buy and nothing goes bad in the fridge.

That being said, if you like to get take out occasionally as a treat, I find it to be an incredibly frugal and healthy alternative, plus because it’s cooked fresh right before you eat it so generally it’s nicer than takeout that’s been sitting in a container for who knows how long.

Finally, and this maybe goes against the grain of this sub, but if it’s what makes cooking possible and means you aren’t ordering take out every night right now, then I think you should go for it. Personally that’s not for me (cooking every night??? no way!!!), but we all need to make the best decisions we can given the unique situations we’re all in. If you’re at a place right now where planning your meals and managing grocery shopping is adding undue stress to your life, and you can afford to eat mostly Hello Fresh, then sometimes paying a bit more is well worth the reduced mental load."
"Well, prices for food increase the more things are being done for you. Even at the grocery store, cut veggies are more expensive than raw veggies.   


So, if you really want to save money, you buy big quantities (of ingredients that doesn't spoil), unprepared food on sale and you store it (small freezer for meat and stuff, fridge for the rest).   


Hello fresh is not bad, but it's half way between grocery store prices and eating out...   


I personally use Mealime app ([https://www.mealime.com/](https://www.mealime.com/)) but I make a lot of substitutions to fit what is on sale and what I have on hand. I also avoid fresh herbs as they are more expensive unless you grow them yourself (which I do for some of it... like basil and mint)  


When chicken is on sale, I usually buy 4-5 kilos of it, same for beef cubes, steaks, etc. Cheap meals are usually pasta and tofu based, where you can make 6 portion for less than 10$...   


So, bulk and family size, sale items and that's it!"
I jump from food delivery to food delivery using their promotions to get the first month or so of deliveries at a discount. After the intro price I’ll switch to a competitor and so on. After cancelling your sub for an extended time a lot of them will offer you a resub deal.
"I found hello fresh to be a frugal alternative to eating out, but not as much to grocery shopping. If you're eating out multiple times a week, getting hello fresh will reduce that."
"I personally only spend money on meal delivery if the meals are already cooked (I use CookUnity). Paying extra, I need enough benefit like not having to prepare the meals, having portion sizes and calories calculated already figured out for weight loss goals, etc.

If I was going to have to cook it anyway, I would definitely shop at the store. Not nearly as much plastic that way either. That’s just me.
Maybe work on stockpiling recipes."
"We did HelloFresh for a few months and really liked a lot of the food but we ended up canceling because there just wasn't enough to keep the rotation from getting stale. I do still miss the chicken sausage from time to time, it was sooo good. On the plus side, the recipes they send with the dishes help you get better at cooking and you can always buy the ingredients for the dishes and make them yourself. One thing that helped cut down spending was weekly meal planning, plan out what you want to cook for the week and try to use as many of the same ingredients (in different ways to shake it up) in each meal for the week to cut down on waste/cost."
"Hello Fresh is VERY expensive. I order from them every couple years just when I feel like trying new recipes but you can get everything at the supermarket for 1/5th of the price. 

[**Tip: The German site tells you the recipes with the ingredients.**](https://www.hellofresh.de/menus/)You can get everything yourself from any grocery store and prepare it yourself (use chromes built in translation)."
"I had to cancel after three weeks. First week I was shorted, the second week I was doubled and the third week had extra but the food was bad when I got it. The meats were black and the vegetables had mold on them. I got my money back but never tried them again."
"I spend a lot of money on food but always trying to toe the line of being healthy and eating well and not restricting myself, enjoying life and not saying no to going out with friends.

But now that I got a pressure cooker, it makes cooking easier for me and I use more dried beans etc since it's quicker to cook and with zero supervision and I mealprep using my pressure cooker.

If you hate buying groceries and hello fresh adds to the quality of your life, I think it's worth it?"
"nothign to add to what other people said. just another data point

&#x200B;

i loved hello fresh. they had so many awesome recipes. but the portions are kind of small so we switched to 4 person meal plans for 2 people, so it stopped being very cheap (still cheaper than restaurants though). Their flatbread recipes were literally some of my favorite meals ive had like..ever

&#x200B;

and also the veggies started being worse and worse quality, and I'm always really sketched out by food that is bad or close to going bad, and I just didn't want to eat the meals half the time, so we stopped getting it"
"I did the subscription food boxes for a while. Ultimately, the things that most influenced my decision to stop were the fact that it was cheaper to do the shopping myself and the fact that all the internal packaging was so wasteful. I would feel guilty for all the single use plastic in each box that it became the main reason I stopped using these subscriptions.

ETA: to answer your question about budgeting, I end up buying chicken and any other meats in bulk and repackaging and freezing at home. I have recipes that are my favs and easy to make (30 mins or less), and I make those in bulk as well, making several days worth of food at a time. For example, we either grill a bunch of chicken or throw chicken drumsticks in the slow cooker. I just change the side dishes or final prep (ie making tacos with the proteins to change the dish and flavor). This has definitely helped to keep grocery bills down and help keep waste down as well. Hope this helps."
"I tried Hello Fresh once when I first moved and I got a ridiculous deal, something like $10 for 2  recipes for two people. (I live alone.) I didn't love it, bc I had to make adjustments for salt intake, because it was more work than I felt like doing at the time, and bc realistically, I'm always going to eat both servings at once.   


Does  it have to be comparable meals? I understand that you have recipes from Hello Fresh that you've already tested but can you replace some of the more expensive ingredients? Or find another source for recipes altogether that fit your budget?"
"It's good to get ideas from and gain confidence in cooking new and different meals. What I done was do it for a few weeks, and keep the recipe cards you get from the meals I liked the most, then went to the supermarket and bought the ingredients myself, saves some money that way.

Don't know if you've noticed though but most of the ingredients have white or red onion, garlic, and cream fraise in a lot of recipes, which can get boring after a while. 

It's great if you cba going the supermarket and don't have time to look for new recipes though 👍 would recommend trying for a few weeks, but see what you like and keep recipe cards to do them yourself at some point."
My girlfriend and I but the ingredients for their meals ourselves. You can view the recipe for free. It’s a bit cheaper. Many of the spice blends have been posted on the Internet so we do our best to recreate them. The meals are still great
"Try EveryPlate or Dinnerly, they are half that cost"
"There's no way a subscription box is every going to be cheaper than buying and making your own food. Learn to cook, learn to shop smart. I'd only recommend a good box for someone who is short on time for shopping and meal planning that still wants to eat relatively healthy."
"Way too expensive for what it is. The variety has become terrible too

If you’re interested in trying out some of their recipes, they post them all on their website. Just find a few that look interesting and make a shopping list based on that"
"I think hello fresh is a great starting point as they have some bomb recipes and the fact they come on card stock for you to save for later is a plus. What I did is purchase a few boxes, found some recipes I like, and now I just go buy the ingredients myself way cheaper. 

As far as quality I stopped hello fresh because the produce became low quality and even the meats were going bad before I would even get to that recipe in the week. I ended up having to cook most of it at once which at that point I might as well hit the store and meal prep"
"Id like to add the obvious:

Hello Fresh vs doing it yourself:

The latter is alot cheaper"
I loved Blue Apron and kind of miss it. I got ingredients that are unobtainable locally and learned new skills. It was fun too. No regrets
"I haven’t tried hello fresh but I did try green chef and had the same problem lots of other folks are mentioning here: spoiled food. Often right out of the box. Chicken, bell peppers, green beans, etc. spoiled and moldy. 
They were supposed to send a complementary box when it got cancelled due to all the rotten ingredients but it never showed. I think that’s the catch with the meal kits. It was nice to get to try things that I may not have thought of and REALLY nice to not have to go to the grocery store but what’s the point when half the box is unusable?"
"Is no one going to mention HelloFresh’s addiction to butter? 🧈🧈🧈🧈🧈🧈

Their recipes call for gobs of butter and lemon in everything."
"In most places it should be possible to get vegetable packages straight from farmers, it’s not cheaper then going to the store but sure is more healthy/tasty and most even give recipes with them. 

If you invest time in cooking and learn a bit understanding of it you can go a long way in the long run. It’s possible to cook with almost no waste! The scraps you cut off of vegetables, keep them (in refrigerator or freezer) and use for home made bouillon! Got too much to eat? Put them in a soup! (+ possibility for the freezer again!) everyone can cook, IF they take the time and understanding of what they’re doing. Want meat that tastes superb? Rub it in with some salt / marinade it / brine it a day before and there you go! Got some bones and pieces leftover of the meat? Bouillon / soup it! Got a favorite meal from one of your take outs? Make it your mission to perfect that dish on your own! I admit it takes more of your time and effort, but restaurant quality food is within reach! I liked seriouseats a lot because of the science behind cooking they explain, but you got a ton of YouTubers too who can really help out (binging with babish, joshua weissman, my name is andong, pro home cooks, … are some good starters) 

We had hello fresh from a neighbor who was on holiday, I liked the recipes but they were waaaaay to expensive vs what you get… we ended cooking up 2 diners for 2 at once because it was not enough to eat… it’s ready to make etc but I find it really better to make on yourself! And if you want to avoid the store for big shoppings, go for a vegetable package from some farm close by! Trial and error with the recipes and if you’ve had enough put it all together in a soup or quiche. 

And again, I’m admitting that price can still seem expensive vd the store… but I assure you’ll be more satisfied with 2 tomatoes that taste like tomato instead of the 6 you buy in the store for the same price that are all watered down in taste for the extra weight (yes, you’re buying tasteless water in the store)"
Also try emeals if you’re in the us. You pick from tons of recipes on the app and it adds all the ingredients automatically into your Walmart pickup/delivery cart. It’s $5 mo but it saves you a lot of time/effort.
If you’re trying to cut back and hate grocery shopping I just do delivery through Amazon prime (also hate/dread grocery shopping). I have recently started using imperfect foods and I really like it. They often auto fill your cart with things you normally get + a couple extra which really helps me with the decision fatigue I get when grocery shopping.
"If you leave hellofresh for a while and have the app downloaded, it sometimes sends you notifications with discounts to pull you back. I am not going back because of the dead veggies, but I still use the app for recipes.

Another thing i do is to buy ingredients that complement each other, like tomatoes garlic and mozzarella. Or lemon parmesan and butter, and just combine them with different things that week."
I tried hello fresh and wasn’t really a fan. There’s a ton of packaging with the little ingredients too. I gave up on hello fresh and just got a CSA box subscription from a local farm and it runs $30-$80 depending on the box. They’re definitely worth looking into
"They are overpriced for sure. However, the convenience MIGHT be worth it sometimes if they sent you great stuff. Someone bought us a few months as a gift, but roughly 90% of the produce they included was very low quality, wilted, or outright spoiled. That killed any interest I had of keeping it around."
"I loved Hello Fresh simply because I am a horrible planner and it made my life easy for three days a week when I was working full time plus a two hour commute. I let it go about a year ago when I retired but I would love to have it back.

I still am not a fan of grocery stores, I'm far more apt to order online and then pickup but I'm not so good at planning, remember. I still use my Hello Fresh recipes and have found that most of the services do have their recipes published online although you might have to dig to find them. Someone published a link to most of them in a post here a few months ago.

I didn't have issues with veggies going bad, but sometimes I might have to add a potato or two to have enough to feed both of us. I had more issues with missing items than produce going bad. And the meat. It was a bit iffy toward the end. Their customer service always took care of me but it always stressed me out in case I didn't have on hand what was missing.

I can't imagine what it is like now with supply chain issues. But end result for me, I miss it and I wish there was a better quality choice. I'd do it again in a heartbeat if I knew that meat quality was back up."
"Dinnerly is half the price with decent food. I pay $115 for six meals. Each is four servings. So that’s 24 meals for $115. 

If you want a promo code for a free box I can send you one."
"I think unless you were previously buying a lot of expensive food and takeaways etc, HelloFresh and other similar things aren't about saving money. They're a luxury expense that save you time on planning/shopping for/preparing meals, or can help with staying healthy or with learning to cook and trying new recipes, in exchange for spending more. That can totally be worth it if you value those things and can afford it but as far as money goes those services aren't a cheaper option than planning/shopping/preparing meals for yourself."
"We did not have a good experience with Hello Fresh, and other people in my area that I've spoken to have had similar problems. Smelly, expired chicken, the proteins in the box having expiry dates 2 days out from delivery, mushy rotten produce, every time was a crap shoot. We only had it for about a month and had at least one meal in each box that was impossible to use and their only response was to give a credit on a subsequent box. 

I did enjoy not having to plan meals for the times it *did* work, but I found it expensive. We've now added in a few meals to our rotation that are quick and easy and healthier than takeout so it was not a complete loss."
"Any meal delivery service like that is usually not economical, and you get worse quality food and waste a lot of packaging. They're good for people who don't have time to prep properly though.

If you cook more vegetarian meals you'll kill two birds with one stone and eat much cheaper and much healthier. There's some really good meals (lentil dahl, bulgur and chickpeas, vegetable soups) that cost basically nothing and are super good for you. Also arguably tastier than some meat dishes"
"The way I've started to combat this, as someone who just cooks for themselves, if to buy really cheap foods that are easy to portion out for one person (rice, beans, some produce, frozen vegetables, eggs, bread, etc.) cook them in large quantities (if applicable) and just eat the same meal a few times over the next week or so. Herbs and spices are nice luxuries to have on hand (and they do carry health benefits), so I happily eat the cost of them, no pun intended. My meals are hardly ""dishes"" as much as they are ""things I threw together that help me meet certain nutrient requirements,"" but as one person that cooks for themselves, that's all I really need."
[deleted]
"There's an app called Mealime that is very similar concept, but you choose the recipes/meal plan, it creates a shopping list for you and you buy your own ingredients.  There's a free version and a subscription version.  Most of the recipes are pretty affordable until you get into the fancier cuts of red meat.

I like HelloFresh and felt like it was affordable and worth the money when we used it."
"One of best values around is from local farms.  These boxes have fresh veggies and fruit, usually year around.  
Check out if this is your area:  https://www.localharvest.org/csa/"
"I personally would not consider those services either healthy or frugal. I buy good cuts of meat, fresh fruits and veggies and make my own food. MUCH less expensive and healthier. 

The prices you quoted make it $448 a month for lunch and dinner for 6 days a week. Still need 7 days of breakfast and 1 full day of meals each week. So add another $150 and you are up to $598. 

I live in a very costly area of the U.S. Have a rice cooker and have a complex carb cooked every day - brown rice, barley, quinoa, etc.

I spend less than $200 on high quality and healthy food. I have a demanding job, a long commute and my house requires lots of yard work and general maintenance.

For me making simple meals has been the key!! And it keeps me healthy as well.

Last night I had roasted lamb, buckwheat with toasted sesame oil and steamed bok choy. Yum!!

My biggest challenge is lettuce as it goes bad quickly and small amounts are expensive. So I buy in bulk and inevitably some goes bad. And I clean it and wrap it in paper towels to make it last longer.

Open to advice about salads!!!"
Honestly I am surprised they haven't increased prices yet.
HelloFresh is just so expensive.
"Have you tried ordering your groceries and doing curbside pick up? Takes the anxiety out of it for me, no crowds and I can sit and meal plan/compare prices in the comfort of my own home, and don’t get overwhelmed or distracted by shiny thing I don’t need! 
I use Walmart, but I’m sure other big stores have the option. It’s usually free if you order over $50."
"So. Much. Waste.  And every pan, bowl, utensil in your house will be dirty after you’re done cooking."
I can tell you I never get it. Many buy it here at our complex. They leave the stuff outside in the hot sun and rain. I assume they don't give you very good tracking.
We do hello fresh and I love it. It is definitely not the cheapest or healthiest (cream cheese in everything) option but I did it get the variety I get now when it comes to meals and I value that enough to continue it. We find that two portions is typically enough for our three eaters with occasional supplementation.
"Just buy the largest sack of rice you can. Will probably last you 6months to a year for about 20 bucks. Now that your simple carbs are covered look towards legumes or other moderately priced protein to add in. I personally turned to an 80/20 mix of grass fed ground beef that I can get for 8.99 but I know there are cheaper options available as well. I can get about 2-3 meals from one package of meat @ 1.25lbs. Then I add in my vegetables (usually broccoli or Brussel sprouts) and aromatics, total cost per meal is roughly between 5-8 bucks depending on my add in’s. This way I can hit all my macros and eat in a calorie surplus while on a reasonable budget. While the price breakdown is similar, I get to eat roughly twice as much food as hellofesh! I mix in different meals ofc but this is a regular staple for me especially when I’m exercising. Also use onion to stretch your ground meat, about half to a full onion per pound is usually good."
It's frugal for the people who will steal the box off your doorstep.
"Here’s another route, although the upfront investment is a little higher:

* Sous vide. Anova is the super recommended one. I bet you could get one off Offer Up or Whatever Craigslist equiv. for like $50-$60

* Food sealer vacuum and Bags (again used is a great way to save) for the big plug in kind. But the $30 handheld ones look interesting too

* Home Depot pot of Rosemary $12

I’d recommend trying to do an herb garden in general but tbh it’s not the easiest. Except Rosemary, which is basically a weedy bush that will grow to the size of a house eventually. 

Now, buy your chicken, pork, even cheaper cuts of steak in bulk. However don’t just Chuck it in the freezer. 

Take them out of their grocery store packages. 

Chop up your herbs: garlic, ginger, shallots, Rosemary, parsley, tarragon, basil, sage

Get your dried ingredients ready: salt, pepper, tumeric, cumin, Chile flakes, brown sugar, msg

Get your liquids: balsamic, lemon juice, orange juice, white wine vinegar

Now prep:

1. Take a meat
2. Rub with small amount of olive oil
3. Season with salt, pepper, msg + any other dry
4. Toss around in the herbs
5. Add any liquids that go well
6. Put in the vacuum bag, vacuum, freeze

When it comes time to turn these little pre seasoned things into lunches and dinners use the sous vide to again do most the work. You can basically make your sides, like rice and veggies all on a Sunday while you grab a pork, a chicken, a steak and then when they hit their internal temperature?

You pop it out and pan sear. 

Then store in the fridge for the week or eat.

Breaks down to something like for a month of food:

1 hour shopping 
3-5 hours of prep at the freezing stage

Then weekly: 2 hours of prep / cooking.

I don’t like the taste of food after two days in the fridge so I’d probably double it with a Wednesday session as well.

Pro tip: when defrosting, don’t use warm water. Just keep replacing the tap water every 10 minutes. It’ll defrost completely, safely, and won’t cook your food in about an hour.

The main thing here is you can control the portion sizes of your meat. And you can make use of expensive herbs and ingredients fully by using them all day 1.

Brown rice and some veggies are easy ways to make the meals go super far and be super filling."
"Hello fresh was a godsend in the pandemic when I was too afraid to shop, but we got no leftovers and the meals that they provide are from the cheapest ingredients possible - lots of rice, chicken, zucchini, etc - so you can make the meals way cheaper if you just buy yourself and have bunches of leftovers too. Imo it is not economical unless you’re already spending money to eat out/ order in every week. If you make your own food already it is not economical."
"I've tried Gousto and  HelloFresh and I much prefer Gousto. I've had some issues with Gousto such as food going off before the written date sometimes, but with HelloFresh I find that the quality to be much worse, and more expensive. Plus the recipes on HelloFresh are largely quite boring compared to Gousto imo. But idk if I'd consider either as a regular subscription, it gets expensive after the initial offers expire, I just enjoyed trying out the different recipes in a more controlled way, and I can recreate them with store bought ingredients any time now"
"I tried HelloFresh for a bit, and while the cost per week was about the same as me grocery shopping, there was one major thing causing this, which was quantity. The money was the same, but at HelloFresh I only had food for the week. No leftovers, nothing if got a little extra hungry. Grocery shopping left me with way more quantity of food and whenever I cook, I expect the food to last a couple of meals which actually is a lot less stressful in the end because I don’t need to cook every day. 

Plus, some food would come spoilt and while they give you some money back for the ingredient, it kind of sucks cause now you can’t really make the recipe. The only thing I really enjoyed about it was getting to try all kinds of different recipes without having to hunt them down myself. If recipes are all you’re after though, you can just go on the HelloFresh website and find them there."
I used HF for a while and saved all of the recipe cards. I just make them myself in bulk and freeze them. Cheaper and easy!
"I take advantage of the hellofresh promotions, but honestly once you learn a few of their recipes it is definitely cheaper to buy from the store. My main gripe with them is that the produce was always nearly rotten when we received the box."
"I think meal subscription like hello fresh are a great short-term way to try new meals/new flavours/new cuisine even. It can help you learn some cooking techniques to flavour-profiles and can spice up your meal routine, which is great!

Long-term they are over-priced, as like you said once you have staple ingredients or spices you would only need to buy the protein and fresh produce which is a fraction of the price hello fresh charges. I also find them very wasteful with the amount of packaging used.

I know some who live alone prefer meal subscriptions since they get they exact right portion and arn't needing to buy a whole bunch/package of something that will go to waste. If you are cooking for more people then buying from the grocery store is cheaper.

&#x200B;

Some tips for saving money long term:

\- Buy the big packs of spices/herbs you use frequently. Buy smaller packs/bags for recipe specific needs, if you find you are going through the bag fast, the next purchase should be the larger size.

\- Buy flour and sugars on sale (there is always a sale a few weeks before holidays where people do baking; Christmas, thanksgiving, easter, etc.)

\- Buy meat and portion it out in freezer bags then freeze it. 

\- Buy frozen veggies in bags for things you only use a little of at a time, or cut up excess produce and freeze it for later use. When you have onion/celery/carrot/etc. that will go to waste you can cut it up and freeze it, then grab only what you need for cooking later.

\- Buy rice/pasta/beans/onions/potatoes in larger bags and store properly for longer use.

\- Once you have stock items (above) Plan your meals for the week and buy only what is needed. You will spend less weekly and there will be less waste."
Hello Fresh was fun for the week that I used the service. With the initial discount the price was right too! I can cook our meals for less money and have leftovers for the next day at lunch. This keeps us from going out to eat almost in entirety.
"We're on a very strict budget, so we go to stores like Aldi (or a grocery outlet if you dont have an Aldi nearby) for a few staple items, to a farmers market for produce, and to a restaurant supply store for proteins (also for produce in non farmers market months).

We use an instantpot once a week to make flavorful stew or soup and eat it thoughout the week with homemade bread.

We make pb&j for lunch or make hummus in a blender to snack on with veggies. 

We eat eggs wherever we can. 

I grow herbs in the window.

We make one dessert a week.

We'll get seltzer on sale, never soda 

We make our coffee/ tea at home. 

Other than rent/ mortgage, groceries are the next biggest single cost for most households. You get used to not buying all the things you like to eat in order to save money. 

If you can afford it, eat out once a month, and enjoy it. 

Good luck!

"I've used a bunch of meal services over the years. When I was working and going to school full time, Green Chef and Hello Fresh were easy meals after a really long day. I'd make the whole meal on one day, eat the fresh salad or side with some of the main, then pack up most of the main for another night, or for lunch the next day. Hello Fresh taught my boyfriend how to cut and cook things, but I found that the 2 person portions weren't filling him up, and it became more economical to meal plan and shop. We kept the recipe cards from meals we like and still make them, 3 years later.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to me starting grad school at night, and we tried EveryPlate. It was a mess, even though Hello Fresh owns it. We had many deliveries arrive warm, or with rotting/missing items, and it became more work to figure out what we could and couldn't eat from the deliveries than I could deal with. Still kept the recipe cards from the meals we did get to enjoy to make.  


I will say that finding a cheaper market and realizing that you are getting larger food portions can impact the price per meal. So for the similar items from Meijer, you'd be getting enough for leftovers more often than not. I still use the black bean and vegetable enchilada recipe from HelloFresh almost weekly.  I found that with two cans of black beans rather than one split, a zucchini, a packet of large tortillas and either carrots or mushrooms, we can get two meals and two lunches from the recipe with extra tortillas for breakfast burritos or another meal entirely. I really enjoy pepper jack cheese and green salsa, so those items are easy to use up in the extra from the recipe. It brings the cost of the groceries way down per meal rather than the idea of only using these items for this exact recipe and leftover going to waste."
"I much prefer to plan meals and then get what I need from the grocery store. I don't use services like that, but I do deliver them. What I've noticed and heard the last couple years is the quality of what's inside has gone down considerably. If you aren't using most of that stuff within the first two sometimes next day, it spoils."
Mental Anguish!
"Blue apron has been fantastic, fresh produce and meat. Very expensive though."
"HelloFresh doubled our monthly expenditures for food, so we only order it occasionally for a week or two. Over the years, we've gathered a lot of good recipes from them, so now we buy the ingredients ourselves. You still get the variety and new stuff to try, but it's much cheaper."
I found that Gousto had a better variety of meals
boxes like these are excellent for learning new recipes but most certainly the best way to save is to buy fresh produce from your local grocery store. and i dont mean safeway
Dinnerly is a lot cheaper!
"I like Hellofresh for inspiration. However, I have yet to find a cheap provider of those food boxes. I make it way cheaper usually."
"HelloFresh is x2 to x4 more expensive than doing it all yourself. That being said, the meals are delicious and they include a recipe card showing what ingredients you need and how to cook the meal. If you can get a free box, sign up then cancel your subscription a day before the box comes so that you don't have to pay for a second box, and enjoy the meal cards.

If HelloFresh published a recipe book containing their recipe cards, I'd buy it.

Getting a free box really helped my wife and i see the benefit of making our own soup stock, etc."
"I loved hello fresh. Overall, I found it to be more expensive and ended up canceling when some unexpected bills popped up. It was lots of fun having the new recipes and fancier ingredients I wouldn’t usually buy, but I was still buying groceries for the rest of the week. Usually I’m able to add those meals into what I’d usually buy for “regular” meals."
"I tried several meal services like hello fresh Blue Apron and factor… were just ok, like most people
Said sometimes things were “off” tasting and not really great. I live in the US, in the south.. if there is a Publix grocery store in your area the best thing I’ve found if you want quick and easy is their pre made dinners for one.. they are like $7 but are restaurant quality, healthy and not too big or too small of a portion size. They also sell Meal kits with everything you need in a bag with the recipe but they are like $20 for 4 servings. Also getting premade stuff from the deli is a better option than buying a bunch of stuff that goes bad in the fridge because you don’t want to cook ( I’m guilty of that)…..I’d rather pay a little more for convenience than waste food."
I tried it for a couple months. Stopped because I kept getting old or moldy fruit.
"Hello Fresh is much more expensive than grocery shopping for me ($122/week for 5 meals, 10 servings), but it does save you time (which has value) so it really just comes down to how you value things and how much time you have. I also already have a kitchen stocked with spices, oils, vinegar, etc. so I see no need to get more of that and only have to purchase them periodically to restock. I'm not knocking people who use them, I think they are a good tool for people learning to cook or who don't have a lot of time, but as far as frugal goes it does not fit my budget or needs."
"I only did hello fresh for a bit, and I mainly used discounts I got or my friends (who had stopped using hello fresh) got. With those it was cheaper, but once those ran out I stopped"
"I personally didn't like Hello Fresh. It's a good idea for many folks, but the last thing I want to do is cook something that the portions are too small, there are no leftovers for lunch, I have to follow someone else's directions, I have to make room in the fridge for food for a special purpose. It's too hard for me to think my way around the small scale and specificity after a long work day. I just want to space out and make some stir-fry or a batch of bread. Having been a professional cook and a health conscious person, I have a much easier time just preparing normal staples like meats with veggies, and a carb option.   
Try this: when you go to the store, scan the meat section first. Those tend to have the most fluctuating prices, and the meat option in most dishes governs the accompanying sides. After you've picked out your meats, then you can purchase your produce. And carb options can usually stick around in a cupboard (potatoes, pastas, rice) and can be bought in bulk section for cheaper than pre-packaged. Same with spices. Additionally spices can be found in cheap cellophane packages in the grocery ""ethnic"" section. Cheap. Or Wally World will often have $1 spice bins.  
Have you looked into the way bodybuilders and fitness folks organize their food week? Pretty much the same, but you don't have to weigh portions or watch salt as closely.   
Easy example: Chicken, rice, broccoli. Get the big package that has like 5-6 breasts. That's 5-6 meals. Bake/sauté/grill the chicken, rice cooker 5-6 servings rice, steam more than enough broccoli. Chop up the meat while it's hot. Now you can pre-portion everything, or keep it in larger containers in the fridge.   
Do the same on the same night, or the next with another combo like salmon, brussel sprouts, and baked yams. You can interchange the veggies and the carbs so you don't get bored of certain combos. You can throw shredded cheeses on top. Or switch the yam for wheat pasta with cheese. Simple, easy, interchangeable. Reasonably priced according to what's on sale, or what is a good find.   
Slow cookers are your friend. Another easy meal we used to do was shredded chicken on tortilla with cheese. The chicken was a big pack like mentioned above. You put it into a slow cooker with a jar of cheap salsa, I think like a 12 ozer. If you want, you can add cumin and paprika. Slow cook on low 10 hours, or high for maybe 6. You can't really mess it up. Drain the excess water and shred it. If you want to make a deal of it, add a can of corn and black beans when it's done.  
Pot roast (7 bone chuck/chuck roast/chuck shoulder) often is cheap meat, and boullion, carrots, and potatoes are as well.  
Canned beans are cheap and you can make a wicked chili with ground turkey.   
You can do this. You will refine things the way you like!"
I did EveryPlate for quite awhile (Hello Fresh’s cheaper offering). It wasn’t really cheaper but if there was discounts it was pretty competitive considering the convenience and mental load factor. I stopped because it all became very same-y and with the COL increases I couldn’t justify the higher cost anymore.
"Some grocery stores, such as Giant Eagle, are starting to sell their own meal kits now. At least you can actually see all the ingredients in the kit to know if they're fresh or not.

I would do the math though, because they're not exactly cheap. I haven't bought any of them myself, but it's mainly because when I look at what's in the package, I could generally make it cheaper by buying the ingredients separately."
