The BBQ sauce seems pretty neutral, not sweet nor sour. Sweet Baby Rays or Sticky Fingers definitely not at all like it.\\n\\nI whipped up some yummy basting sauce with the EP condiments. Couple packets of Daisy sour cream, packet of beef stock, packet of chicken stock, packet of BBQ sauce, (may have been 2 each of those 3 packets) unmeasured amounts of sweet and smokey BBQ seasoning and fry seasoning, one wee drop of Wright's liquid smoke. Stirred all together cold and kept for a couple weeks of use in my fridge, in a sealable container, never ever going from food back into the bowl with the brush. Mixing was 'to taste', so you do you. ;) IMHO better than Red Robin's smokey fry sauce and it worked great on pork, chicken, steak, and ground beef.\\n\\nUsed the last of it wednesday on some bacon stuffed burger patties topped with provolone.</td>\n",

Seems to be chile forward. After trying a couple times I noticed the sichuan peppercorns too. Otherwise I'm not sure.  Allergen warnings say contains soy and wheat.\n",
       "59  What's in the Italian seasoning? I just quit EveryPlate and have a shaker full of that but I want to be able to replicate it. It's \\*different\\* from McCormick's Italian seasoning.\\n\\nHow about subs for their beef and chicken stock and BBQ sauce packets? The stocks are quite concentrated, apparently not over-salted. The BBQ sauce seems pretty neutral, not sweet nor sour. Sweet Baby Rays or Sticky Fingers definitely not at all like it.\\n\\nI whipped up some yummy basting sauce with the EP condiments. Couple packets of Daisy sour cream, packet of beef stock, packet of chicken stock, packet of BBQ sauce, (may have been 2 each of those 3 packets) unmeasured amounts of sweet and smokey BBQ seasoning and fry seasoning, one wee drop of Wright's liquid smoke. Stirred all together cold and kept for a couple weeks of use in my fridge, in a sealable container, never ever going from food back into the bowl with the brush. Mixing was 'to taste', so you do you. ;) IMHO better than Red Robin's smokey fry sauce and it worked great on pork, chicken, steak, and ground beef.\\n\\nUsed the last of it wednesday on some bacon stuffed burger patties topped with provolone."

       "      <td>It's totally legitimate that you're having difficulty budgeting for one because cooking gets progressively cheaper per meal the more meals you're making at once. Fresh meat and produce in the USA (where I'm guessing you live given you're shopping at Meijer) tends to be sold in quantities that can't be used effectively for one person and shopping for individual veggies is way more expensive per oz than in bulk. Some of the ways you can mitigate this is by:\\n\\n* Planning out your meals for the week such that recipes are using the same ingredients\\n* Adjusting your diet to meal-prepping (and the associated repetitiveness)\\n* Buying perishables that can be frozen, or cooking meals that can be frozen\\n\\nIf you're new to cooking, there are a few things to consider as benefits to a meal order kit: you get all the \"extras\" like oils, spices, etc instead of having to buy them and manage a pantry, you get exposure to new recipes and cooking techniques, and you get a new meal every day (with maybe leftovers for lunch as your only repeats). Subscribing for a few weeks might be what you need to figure out exactly what you like, what your pantry needs, and how you can start planning these sorts of meals for yourself to mitigate the subscription costs. However, I don't think it's a sustainable model and if you're an experienced cook with a good number of recipes you're already comfortable with, it probably isn't worth it to begin with.\\n\\nAlso, as a fellow Midwesterner, you may want to look at other stores than Meijer for price comparisons. Meijer's model has some really good deals on certain items but generally overpriced items throughout the rest of the store. Walmart will have much better prices for spices and Aldi will be better for veggies and meat.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I personally didn't like Hello Fresh. It's a good idea for many folks, but the last thing I want to do is cook something that the portions are too small, there are no leftovers for lunch, I have to follow someone else's directions, I have to make room in the fridge for food for a special purpose. It's too hard for me to think my way around the small scale and specificity after a long work day. I just want to space out and make some stir-fry or a batch of bread. Having been a professional cook and a health conscious person, I have a much easier time just preparing normal staples like meats with veggies, and a carb option.   \\nTry this: when you go to the store, scan the meat section first. Those tend to have the most fluctuating prices, and the meat option in most dishes governs the accompanying sides. After you've picked out your meats, then you can purchase your produce. And carb options can usually stick around in a cupboard (potatoes, pastas, rice) and can be bought in bulk section for cheaper than pre-packaged. Same with spices. Additionally spices can be found in cheap cellophane packages in the grocery \"ethnic\" section. Cheap. Or Wally World will often have $1 spice bins.  \\nHave you looked into the way bodybuilders and fitness folks organize their food week? Pretty much the same, but you don't have to weigh portions or watch salt as closely.   \\nEasy example: Chicken, rice, broccoli. Get the big package that has like 5-6 breasts. That's 5-6 meals. Bake/sauté/grill the chicken, rice cooker 5-6 servings rice, steam more than enough broccoli. Chop up the meat while it's hot. Now you can pre-portion everything, or keep it in larger containers in the fridge.   \\nDo the same on the same night, or the next with another combo like salmon, brussel sprouts, and baked yams. You can interchange the veggies and the carbs so you don't get bored of certain combos. You can throw shredded cheeses on top. Or switch the yam for wheat pasta with cheese. Simple, easy, interchangeable. Reasonably priced according to what's on sale, or what is a good find.   \\nSlow cookers are your friend. Another easy meal we used to do was shredded chicken on tortilla with cheese. The chicken was a big pack like mentioned above. You put it into a slow cooker with a jar of cheap salsa, I think like a 12 ozer. If you want, you can add cumin and paprika. Slow cook on low 10 hours, or high for maybe 6. You can't really mess it up. Drain the excess water and shred it. If you want to make a deal of it, add a can of corn and black beans when it's done.  \\nPot roast (7 bone chuck/chuck roast/chuck shoulder) often is cheap meat, and boullion, carrots, and potatoes are as well.  \\nCanned beans are cheap and you can make a wicked chili with ground turkey.   \\nYou can do this. You will refine things the way you like!</td>\n",

I like trying new recipes and it was cool to get food that I normally wouldn't.  I stopped because the quality of produce went down significantly.   I would get veggies on the verge of spoiling or would be missing ingredients.   You can complain and they will give you money off your next box, but after weeks of this I gave up.  I would also say it's not cheap if you are on a strict budget.  I could make similar foods that are cheaper.  It was great to try out and learn, but I dont think its worth it if you are trying to eat cheap.\n",

Fresh meat and produce in the USA (where I'm guessing you live given you're shopping at Meijer) tends to be sold in quantities that can't be used effectively for one person and shopping for individual veggies is way more expensive per oz than in bulk. Some of the ways you can mitigate this is by:\\n\\n* Planning out your meals for the week such that recipes are using the same ingredients\\n* Adjusting your diet to meal-prepping (and the associated repetitiveness)\\n* Buying perishables that can be frozen, or cooking meals that can be frozen\\n\\nIf you're new to cooking, there are a few things to consider as benefits to a meal order kit: you get all the \"extras\" like oils, spices, etc instead of having to buy them and manage a pantry, you get exposure to new recipes and cooking techniques, and you get a new meal every day (with maybe leftovers for lunch as your only repeats). Subscribing for a few weeks might be what you need to figure out exactly what you like, what your pantry needs, and how you can start planning these sorts of meals for yourself to mitigate the subscription costs. However, I don't think it's a sustainable model and if you're an experienced cook with a good number of recipes you're already comfortable with, it probably isn't worth it to begin with.\\n\\nAlso, as a fellow Midwesterner, you may want to look at other stores than Meijer for price comparisons. Meijer's model has some really good deals on certain items but generally overpriced items throughout the rest of the store. Walmart will have much better prices for spices and Aldi will be better for veggies and meat.\n",

The cheapest meal box we used was Dinnerly.  Exponentially less than Hello Fresh, minimal plastic packaging. Every Plate was a close 2nd as far as costs. I do wish both had fewer dairy based recipes.\\n\\nAs someone who HATES meal planning and shopping (99% of the time I do drive up or delivery svcs), having the meal plans was worth any money saved vs couponing, going to multiple shops.\n",

I also already have a kitchen stocked with spices, oils, vinegar, etc. so I see no need to get more of that and only have to purchase them periodically to restock. I'm not knocking people who use them, I think they are a good tool for people learning to cook or who don't have a lot of time, but as far as frugal goes it does not fit my budget or needs.\n",

       "95  I personally didn't like Hello Fresh. It's a good idea for many folks, but the last thing I want to do is cook something that the portions are too small, there are no leftovers for lunch, I have to follow someone else's directions, I have to make room in the fridge for food for a special purpose. It's too hard for me to think my way around the small scale and specificity after a long work day. I just want to space out and make some stir-fry or a batch of bread. Having been a professional cook and a health conscious person, I have a much easier time just preparing normal staples like meats with veggies, and a carb option.   \\nTry this: when you go to the store, scan the meat section first. Those tend to have the most fluctuating prices, and the meat option in most dishes governs the accompanying sides. After you've picked out your meats, then you can purchase your produce. And carb options can usually stick around in a cupboard (potatoes, pastas, rice) and can be bought in bulk section for cheaper than pre-packaged. Same with spices. Additionally spices can be found in cheap cellophane packages in the grocery \"ethnic\" section. Cheap. Or Wally World will often have $1 spice bins.  \\nHave you looked into the way bodybuilders and fitness folks organize their food week? Pretty much the same, but you don't have to weigh portions or watch salt as closely.   \\nEasy example: Chicken, rice, broccoli. Get the big package that has like 5-6 breasts. That's 5-6 meals. Bake/sauté/grill the chicken, rice cooker 5-6 servings rice, steam more than enough broccoli. Chop up the meat while it's hot. Now you can pre-portion everything, or keep it in larger containers in the fridge.   \\nDo the same on the same night, or the next with another combo like salmon, brussel sprouts, and baked yams. You can interchange the veggies and the carbs so you don't get bored of certain combos. You can throw shredded cheeses on top. Or switch the yam for wheat pasta with cheese. Simple, easy, interchangeable. Reasonably priced according to what's on sale, or what is a good find.   \\nSlow cookers are your friend. Another easy meal we used to do was shredded chicken on tortilla with cheese. The chicken was a big pack like mentioned above. You put it into a slow cooker with a jar of cheap salsa, I think like a 12 ozer. If you want, you can add cumin and paprika. Slow cook on low 10 hours, or high for maybe 6. You can't really mess it up. Drain the excess water and shred it. If you want to make a deal of it, add a can of corn and black beans when it's done.  \\nPot roast (7 bone chuck/chuck roast/chuck shoulder) often is cheap meat, and boullion, carrots, and potatoes are as well.  \\nCanned beans are cheap and you can make a wicked chili with ground turkey.   \\nYou can do this. You will refine things the way you like!\n",

It wasn’t really cheaper but if there was discounts it was pretty competitive considering the convenience and mental load factor. I stopped because it all became very same-y and with the COL increases I couldn’t justify the higher cost anymore.\n",

At least you can actually see all the ingredients in the kit to know if they're fresh or not.\\n\\nI would do the math though, because they're not exactly cheap. I haven't bought any of them myself, but it's mainly because when I look at what's in the package, I could generally make it cheaper by buying the ingredients separately.\n",

       "      <td>It's totally legitimate that you're having difficulty budgeting for one because cooking gets progressively cheaper per meal the more meals you're making at once. Fresh meat and produce in the USA (where I'm guessing you live given you're shopping at Meijer) tends to be sold in quantities that can't be used effectively for one person and shopping for individual veggies is way more expensive per oz than in bulk. Some of the ways you can mitigate this is by:\\n\\n* Planning out your meals for the week such that recipes are using the same ingredients\\n* Adjusting your diet to meal-prepping (and the associated repetitiveness)\\n* Buying perishables that can be frozen, or cooking meals that can be frozen\\n\\nIf you're new to cooking, there are a few things to consider as benefits to a meal order kit: you get all the \"extras\" like oils, spices, etc instead of having to buy them and manage a pantry, you get exposure to new recipes and cooking techniques, and you get a new meal every day (with maybe leftovers for lunch as your only repeats). Subscribing for a few weeks might be what you need to figure out exactly what you like, what your pantry needs, and how you can start planning these sorts of meals for yourself to mitigate the subscription costs. However, I don't think it's a sustainable model and if you're an experienced cook with a good number of recipes you're already comfortable with, it probably isn't worth it to begin with.\\n\\nAlso, as a fellow Midwesterner, you may want to look at other stores than Meijer for price comparisons. Meijer's model has some really good deals on certain items but generally overpriced items throughout the rest of the store. Walmart will have much better prices for spices and Aldi will be better for veggies and meat.</td>\n",

I like trying new recipes and it was cool to get food that I normally wouldn't.  I stopped because the quality of produce went down significantly.   I would get veggies on the verge of spoiling or would be missing ingredients.   You can complain and they will give you money off your next box, but after weeks of this I gave up.  I would also say it's not cheap if you are on a strict budget.  I could make similar foods that are cheaper.  It was great to try out and learn, but I dont think its worth it if you are trying to eat cheap.   \n",
       "1  It's totally legitimate that you're having difficulty budgeting for one because cooking gets progressively cheaper per meal the more meals you're making at once. Fresh meat and produce in the USA (where I'm guessing you live given you're shopping at Meijer) tends to be sold in quantities that can't be used effectively for one person and shopping for individual veggies is way more expensive per oz than in bulk. Some of the ways you can mitigate this is by:\\n\\n* Planning out your meals for the week such that recipes are using the same ingredients\\n* Adjusting your diet to meal-prepping (and the associated repetitiveness)\\n* Buying perishables that can be frozen, or cooking meals that can be frozen\\n\\nIf you're new to cooking, there are a few things to consider as benefits to a meal order kit: you get all the \"extras\" like oils, spices, etc instead of having to buy them and manage a pantry, you get exposure to new recipes and cooking techniques, and you get a new meal every day (with maybe leftovers for lunch as your only repeats). Subscribing for a few weeks might be what you need to figure out exactly what you like, what your pantry needs, and how you can start planning these sorts of meals for yourself to mitigate the subscription costs. However, I don't think it's a sustainable model and if you're an experienced cook with a good number of recipes you're already comfortable with, it probably isn't worth it to begin with.\\n\\nAlso, as a fellow Midwesterner, you may want to look at other stores than Meijer for price comparisons. Meijer's model has some really good deals on certain items but generally overpriced items throughout the rest of the store. Walmart will have much better prices for spices and Aldi will be better for veggies and meat.   \n",

You can buy your own equivalents for much less, though I understand the appeal for those who want to try dishes they've never made before without all the research, planning and shopping required to do that on your own.   \n",

I like trying new recipes and it was cool to get food that I normally wouldn't.  I stopped because the quality of produce went down significantly.   I would get veggies on the verge of spoiling or would be missing ingredients.   You can complain and they will give you money off your next box, but after weeks of this I gave up.  I would also say it's not cheap if you are on a strict budget.  I could make similar foods that are cheaper.  It was great to try out and learn, but I dont think its worth it if you are trying to eat cheap.  \n",
       "1  It's totally legitimate that you're having difficulty budgeting for one because cooking gets progressively cheaper per meal the more meals you're making at once. Fresh meat and produce in the USA (where I'm guessing you live given you're shopping at Meijer) tends to be sold in quantities that can't be used effectively for one person and shopping for individual veggies is way more expensive per oz than in bulk. Some of the ways you can mitigate this is by:\\n\\n* Planning out your meals for the week such that recipes are using the same ingredients\\n* Adjusting your diet to meal-prepping (and the associated repetitiveness)\\n* Buying perishables that can be frozen, or cooking meals that can be frozen\\n\\nIf you're new to cooking, there are a few things to consider as benefits to a meal order kit: you get all the \"extras\" like oils, spices, etc instead of having to buy them and manage a pantry, you get exposure to new recipes and cooking techniques, and you get a new meal every day (with maybe leftovers for lunch as your only repeats). Subscribing for a few weeks might be what you need to figure out exactly what you like, what your pantry needs, and how you can start planning these sorts of meals for yourself to mitigate the subscription costs. However, I don't think it's a sustainable model and if you're an experienced cook with a good number of recipes you're already comfortable with, it probably isn't worth it to begin with.\\n\\nAlso, as a fellow Midwesterner, you may want to look at other stores than Meijer for price comparisons. Meijer's model has some really good deals on certain items but generally overpriced items throughout the rest of the store. Walmart will have much better prices for spices and Aldi will be better for veggies and meat.  \n",

The cheapest meal box we used was Dinnerly.  Exponentially less than Hello Fresh, minimal plastic packaging. Every Plate was a close 2nd as far as costs. I do wish both had fewer dairy based recipes.\\n\\nAs someone who HATES meal planning and shopping (99% of the time I do drive up or delivery svcs), having the meal plans was worth any money saved vs couponing, going to multiple shops.
